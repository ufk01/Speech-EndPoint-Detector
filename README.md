# Speech-EndPoint-Detector
The necessity of the task is to determine the starting and ending points of the speech in a given audio recording. 
Identifying the start and end points of speech allows segments of speech to be cut or parsed in addition to processing or analysis. 
We also showed the magnitude and zero-crossing expressions as an extra in the project. We showed each result we found on the table (plotting).
